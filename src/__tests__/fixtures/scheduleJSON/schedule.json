Not only among themselves, but also in the neighborhood or in cooperation with emergency services. However, this help has changed over the years, as our everyday communication has also changed. In this brief presentation, I would therefore like to show what consequences it has for us if communication is no longer possible and what thoughts we radio amateurs have about this and what activities we try to put into practice, but also where there are problems and where non-radio amateurs can also contribute their knowledge and commitment."
