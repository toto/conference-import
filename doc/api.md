# Basics

## Requests and Responses

The API is RESTful, so all you have to do is to call a specified URL and you will get a JSON result.

For example: If you call <http://data.re-publica.de/api/events> you should receive something like this:

``` javascript
{
	"ok": true,
	"count": 1,
	"data": [{
		"type": "event",
		"id": "rp13",
		"label": "re:publica 13",
		"title": "IN/SIDE/OUT",
		"date": [ "2013-05-06", "2013-05-08" ],
		"locations": [{
			"label": "Station Berlin",
			"coords": [ 52.49814, 13.374538 ]
		}],
		"url": "http://13.re-publica.de/"
	}]
}
```

The response is always an object with the properties:

* ```ok``` is true or false and shows, whether the request was successful. If it was successful also the following properties will be set:
* ```count``` shows the number of total results
* ```data``` is an array with the results

## Single Objects and Lists

If you are requesting for a single, existing object (e.g. by an object id) ```count``` will always be 1 and ```data``` will always be an array with a single object.

If you are requesting for a list of objects (e.g. all sessions) ```count``` will always be the total number of known objects (e.g. sessions) and ```data``` will always be an array with the results.

## Modification Time

Every element has the field ```last_modified``` containing the Unix time (in seconds) of the last change.

You can use that to filter lists. E.g. ```http://data.re-publica.de/api/rp13/speakers?last_modified=1393611456``` returns only speaker entries, that have changed since Unix time ```1393611456```.

## Pagination

When requesting for a list you can use the special GET parameters ```start``` and ```count``` for pagination.

E.g. <http://data.re-publica.de/api/rp13/sessions> will list all sessions:
``` javascript
{
	"ok": true,
	"count": 347,
	"data": [
		// ... list of 347 session objects
	]
}
```
The same request with pagination [...sessions?start=100&count=20](http://data.re-publica.de/api/rp13/sessions?start=100&count=20) will list only the requested 20 sessions - starting with the 100th:
``` javascript
{
	"ok": true,
	"count": 347, // count will still show the number of all sessions
	"data": [
		// ... list of the requested 20 session objects
	]
}
```


# Reference

In the following reference examples only the content of the ```data``` property will be shown.

## Optional and Required Properties

Several properties are marked as optional. If they are not marked as optional they should be considered required even if not marked as such. 

If you want to specify an optional property as not present explicity (i.e. delete it if it has been there before) specify an explicit `null` value for the optional property. 

## Formats

Most basic types are defined by JSON

- `string`: JSON String
- `number`: JSON Number
- `date`: JSON String representing an ISO 8601 Date (no time)
- `datetime`: JSON String representing an ISO 8601 Date and Time
- `boolean`: JSON Bool (true/false)


## Events

An event is one chronologically delimited total of sessions. Like a yearly conference.

	- `map`: (Required) Identifier of the map. **Note:** A map identifier may only occur once in the `positions` property (aka a POI may only be placed on a map once)
	- `x` and `y` (Required) Position of this POI on the map. These are pixel coordinates in the coordinate system of the `map`. 
	  The coorinates are pixels on the original size of the map (`tiles.size.width` and `tiles.size.height` properties). 
	  The origin of the coordinate system is located on the *bottom left*. 
- `geo_position`: (Optional) Location of this POI in the WGS84 coordinate system. Single map with the following keys:
	 - `lat`: (Required) Geographical latitude in WGS84 coordinates in degrees (float)

- `category`: (Required) Category of the POI.  Pick one:
		- `session-location` - A typical session location (Auditorium, lecutre hall, etc.)
		- `workshop-location` - A workshop area 
		- `service` - Cash desk, info point, etc.
		- `safety`

	- `url` (Required) URL 
	- `title` (Optional) Title of the link
	- `type` (Required): Link type, see Session or Speaker above
- `hidden`: (Optional) If not present should be assumed `false`, if `true` identifies a POI that should not be shown in UI (e.g. only for beacon positioning), might be ignored by the client if deemed appropriate.
- `priority`: (Optional) If not present should be assumed `0`. Can be used to identify the relative priority of this POI to others. Use full e.g. if clustering is needed or filtering needs to be performed for performance reasons on the client.
- `beacons`: (Optional) An array of maps, each representing a Bluetooth 4.0 LE beacon (aka [iBeacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon)) marking this POI. 
			 A beacon has `uuid`, `major` and `minor` ID, where UUID might be the same for the whole conference or even beyond, so only the three properties in combination identifiy a uniq beacon. All three are required.  
			 Note: Only beacons whose presence identififies this POI should be here, not merely beacons who are close by.
